&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;id, it is ignored and automatically generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date, it is ignored and automaticcally set to time of subscription creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;duration (in hour), if not specified (or if the given value is less than 1), it is set to -1 which means that
the subscription has an infinite duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;status, it is ignored and set to PENDING by default&lt;/li&gt;

companyProfile. When currentDate is greater than subscriptionCreationDate + duration, the
subscription status became DEACTIVATED (stopped).
