<h1>Some Kind of Project</h1>
<p> currently implemented in <em>php</em>7</p>
<h2>to dynamically create Class Interfaces, Traits or Objects from xsd, wadl</h2>
<p> and probably more XML'ish api representations to interact with the api behind it. </p>
<h2>This Project</h2>
<p>is basically a try to generify my work with the <a href="//github.com/uni-halle/gw14-shell/">GroupWise 2014 wadl abtsraction into PHP and Linux Shell</a>. There once was some kind of Java-Application on google code. But i never could get the stuff working. As this was some kind of scientific project, I decided to do some research myself.</p>
<h2>The Target</h2>
<p>is set quite high. By using some kind of code-templates it shall be possible to export the abstraction into a various set of programming languages.<p>
<h2>Aporaches</h2>
<p>There are a few approaches I'm going to have a look at:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reguar Expressions</li>
	<li>DOM+Xpath?</li>
	<li>XML-Reader Handler</li>
	<li>Make use of libjquery?</li>
	<li>XSLT+PHP?</li>
</ul>
