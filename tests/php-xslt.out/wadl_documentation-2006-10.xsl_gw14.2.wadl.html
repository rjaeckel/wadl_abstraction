  may not match up with what the admin service is configured with if
  some of the services have not yet been configured with an admin
  port or have explicitly disabled the admin service.Claim a token or poll it's status.
 &lt;p&gt;
    The token must be in the 'authorized' state
    in order to claim. If a token has yet not been authorized then this method will
    return 200 OK but return a token that is still in the 'issued' state. The client
    must further poll until the token is authorized and it returned as claimed (i.e.
    the 'claimed' date/time stamp is set to non-null and the 'secret' value is set.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
    Once a token is claimed the token id can be used as the basic auth username for
    the install API and the 'secret' can be used as the basic auth password. The
    token will be valid for authentication for 1 hour.

 &lt;p&gt;The token returned from this method will be in an 'issued' state. It will
  need to be authorized and claimed before it can be used for installation.
  To authorize the token you need to run the following command on the host
  running the admin service:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gwadmin-ipc authorize [token]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the token has been authorized it can be claimed. To claim the token
  issue an HTTP GET on the /install/tokens/[token] endpoint. The claimed token
  will contain a 'secret' that can be used in conjunction with the token id to
  form Basic AUTH credentials for the install API.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An issued token must be claimed within 5 minutes or it will expire.&lt;/p&gt;Get a list of Scheduled Events defined in this system. The list can be filtered by passing attribute/value pairs in the

 The request object must contain the id of the destination post office as well as a list containing one or more user ids. Each user
 entry in the source list can optionally specify whether or not they want to create a nickname on the source post office and a new
 owner for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;pre&gt;
 {
 	"postOfficeId": "POST_OFFICE.Dom1.Po2",
 	"sources": [
 		{"id": "USER.Dom1.Po1.User1", "createNickname": "true"},
 		{"id": "USER.Dom1.Po1.User2"},
 		{"id": "RESOURCE.Dom1.Po1.Rsrc1", "resourceOwnerId": "USER.Dom1.Po1.User3"},
 	]
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the request is well formed and the destination post office is valid then a 200 OK response will be returned with a response entity
 that encodes the success or failure of the individual move operations. The caller MUST examine the response entity to determine if
 the move succeeded for a given and not just assume that a 200 OK means that the move succeeded.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;
 The response entity will contain the number of user moves that succeeded in addition to a collection of errors that were encountered
 for user moves that failed. The caller can determine that the entire move succeeded if the number of users that succeeded in the
 response match the number of users that were requested to move in the request entity. Individual failures are identified by the id
 that was passed into the move request.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;
 When moving a resource, the new owner field is required. The owner must be the id of a user that exists on the destination post
 office. If the resource owner is not specified then the move will fail with a status of FORBIDDEN and an error code of INVALID_OWNER
 (0xDB04).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;
 When moving a user, the new resource owner field is only required in cases where the user owns resources on the source post office.
 In this case, the new resource owner must be another user on the source post office that the owned resources will be reassigned to.
 If the user owns resources and no resource owner is specified the move will fail with a status of FORBIDDEN and an error code of
 OWNED_RSRC_EXISTS (0xDB09).
 &lt;/p&gt;Remove all Move User Status objects with a status of Complete.Run an action on the specified user move status. Actions are one of (case-insensitive):
 &lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;RETRY&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;Submit a retry of the current step of the user move to the post office&lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;SKIP_MAILBOX_ITEM&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;Skip the current mailbox item blocking the move process and continue with the move&lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;STOP_DEFERRED_RETRIES&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;RESTART&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;Restart the whole user move process&lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;REQUEST_PENDING_ITEMS&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;Submit a request to the post office to build a list of pending items.&lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;FORCE_COMPLETE&lt;/dt&gt;
