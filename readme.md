# Some Kind of Project
currently implemented in _php7_

## to dynamically create Class Interfaces, Traits or Objects from xsd, wadl
and probably more XML'ish api representations to interact with the api behind it.

## This Project
is basically a try to generify my work with the [GroupWise 2014 WADL abstraction into PHP and Linux Shell](//github.com/uni-halle/gw14-shell/tree/master/api-gen).

There once was some kind of Java-Application on google code. But i never could get the stuff working. As this was some kind of scientific project, I decided to do some research myself.

## The Target
is set quite high. By using some kind of code-templates it shall be possible to export the abstraction into a various set of programming languages.<p>

## Approaches

There are a few options I'm going to have a look at:

  * Regular Expressions?
  * DOM+Xpath?
  * XML-Reader Handler
  * Make use of libjquery ?
  * XSLT + PHP ?
